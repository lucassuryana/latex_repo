abstract = {Until upcoming autonomous vehicles can handle every scenario in all operation domains there will be situations, in which the human driver needs to retrieve control of the vehicle. This can lead to safety issues as literature shows impaired driving performance after taking over from highly automated driving. A discrete switch of control might be a valid option to hand over to an attentive human driver. However, it is questionable if this is a safe way for a transition of control to somebody who is distracted at the time of the takeover request. Instead, gradually shifting control via a period of haptic shared control can provide guidance during the process of establishing situation awareness. Here, we present different design concepts for handing over control from a controller to a human partner. To analyze these concepts, we designed an experiment, in which the participants need to take over a simplified steering task when requested by the automation. We conducted a study comparing two discrete switching transitions and three concepts in which the authority of the controller fades out slowly. The results show that in situations, needing a continuation of the control action of the automation, an early switch-off underperformed compared to the other concepts. If the situation demanded action during the transition the shared control approaches achieved the lowest tracking error. A survey of the participants revealed that gradually shifting transitions lead to a sense of better performance and are also regarded as more comfortable. The best overall results were obtained by a concept which models human behavior and considers it within the takeover process. This approach provides a systematic method for the design of authority transitions by finding the best trade-off between guidance and handover.},

abstract = {Fully autonomous or “self-driving” vehicles are an emerging technology that may hold tremendous mobility potential for individuals who are visually impaired who have been previously disadvantaged by an inability to operate conventional motor vehicles. Prior studies however, have suggested that these consumers have significant concerns regarding the accessibility of this technology and their ability to effectively interact with it. We present the results of a quasi-naturalistic study, conducted on public roads with 20 visually impaired users, designed to test a self-driving vehicle human–machine interface. This prototype system, ATLAS, was designed in participatory workshops in collaboration with visually impaired persons with the intent of satisfying the experiential needs of blind and low vision users. Our results show that following interaction with the prototype, participants expressed an increased trust in self-driving vehicle technology, an increased belief in its likely usability, an increased desire to purchase it and a reduced fear of operational failures. These findings suggest that interaction with even a simulated self-driving vehicle may be sufficient to ameliorate feelings of distrust regarding the technology and that existing technologies, properly combined, are promising solutions in addressing the experiential needs of visually impaired persons in similar contexts.},

abstract = {Objective: The human–machine interface (HMI) is a crucial part of every automated driving system (ADS). In the near future, it is likely that—depending on the operational design domain (ODD)—different levels of automation will be available within the same vehicle. The capabilities of a given automation level as well as the operator's responsibilities must be communicated in an appropriate way. To date, however, there are no agreed-upon evaluation methods that can be used by human factors practitioners as well as researchers to test this. Methods: We developed an iterative test procedure that can be applied during the product development cycle of ADS. The test procedure is specifically designed to evaluate whether minimum requirements as proposed in NHTSA's automated vehicle policy are met. Results: The proposed evaluation protocol includes (a) a method to identify relevant use cases for testing on the basis of all theoretically possible steady states and mode transitions of a given ADS; (b) an expert-based heuristic assessment to evaluate whether the HMI complies with applicable norms, standards, and best practices; and (c) an empirical evaluation of ADS HMIs using a standardized design for user studies and performance metrics. Conclusions: Each can be used as a stand-alone method or in combination to generate objective, reliable, and valid evaluations of HMIs, focusing on whether they meet minimum requirements. However, we also emphasize that other evaluation aspects such as controllability, misuse, and acceptance are not within the scope of the evaluation protocol.},

abstract = {Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) aim to increase safety and reduce mental workload. However, the gap in the understanding of the closed-loop driver-vehicle interaction often leads to reduced user acceptance. In this article, an optimal torque control law is calculated online in the model predictive control (MPC) framework to guarantee continuous guidance during the steering task. The research contribution is in the integration of an extensive prediction model covering cognitive behavior, neuromuscular dynamics, and the vehicle-steering dynamics, within the MPC-based haptic controller to enhance collaboration. The driver model is composed of a preview cognitive strategy based on a linear-quadratic-gaussian, sensory organs, and neuromuscular dynamics, including muscle coactivation and reflex action. Moreover, an adaptive cost-function algorithm enables dynamic allocation of the control authority. Experiments were performed in a fixed-base driving simulator at Toyota Motor Europe involving 19 participants to evaluate the proposed controller with two different cost functions against a commercial lane keeping assist system as an industry benchmark. The results demonstrate the proposed controller fosters symbiotic driving and reduces driver-vehicle conflicts with respect to a state-of-the-art commercial system, both subjectively and objectively, while still improving the path-tracking performance. Summarising, this article tackles the need to blend human and ADAS control, demonstrating the validity of the proposed strategy.},

abstract = {Real-time risk assessment of autonomous driving at tactical and operational levels is extremely challenging since both contextual and circumferential factors should concurrently be considered. Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics. In particular, interaction-aware motion models that take inter-vehicle dependencies into account by utilizing the Bayesian interference are employed to mutually control multiple factors. However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a new risk assessment methodology that integrates a network-level collision estimate with a vehicle-based risk estimate in real-time under the joint framework of interaction-aware motion models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone. Hence, it was concluded that a well-calibrated collision prediction classifier provides a crucial hint for better risk perception by autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {The onset of autonomous driving has provided fertile ground for discussions about ethics in recent years. These discussions are heavily documented in the scientific literature and have mainly revolved around extreme traffic situations depicted as moral dilemmas, i.e. situations in which the autonomous vehicle (AV) is required to make a difficult moral choice. Quite surprisingly, little is known about the ethical issues in focus by the AV industry. General claims have been made about the struggles of companies regarding the ethical issues of AVs but these lack proper substantiation. As private companies are highly influential on the development and acceptance of AV technologies, a meaningful debate about the ethics of AVs should take into account the ethical issues prioritised by industry. In order to assess the awareness and engagement of industry on the ethics of AVs, we inspected the narratives in the official business and technical reports of companies with an AV testing permit in California. The findings of our literature and industry review suggest that: (i) given the plethora of ethical issues addressed in the reports, autonomous driving companies seem to be aware of and engaged in the ethics of autonomous driving technology; (ii) scientific literature and industry reports prioritise safety and cybersecurity; (iii) scientific and industry communities agree that AVs will not eliminate the risk of accidents; (iv) scientific literature on AV technology ethics is dominated by discussions about the trolley problem; (v) moral dilemmas resembling trolley cases are not addressed in industry reports but there are nuanced allusions that unravel underlying concerns about these extreme traffic situations; (vi) autonomous driving companies have different approaches with respect to the authority of remote operators; and (vii) companies seem invested in a lowest liability risk design strategy relying on rules and regulations, expedite investigations, and crash/collision avoidance algorithms.},

abstract = {The concept of meaningful human control has been proposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans (e.g., users, designers and developers, manufacturers, legislators). However, the relevant discussions around meaningful human control have so far not resulted in clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers. As a result, there is no consensus on how to assess whether a designed AI system is under meaningful human control, making the practical development of AI-based systems that remain under meaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying four actionable properties which AI-based systems must have to be under meaningful human control. First, a system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate and mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a human should be commensurate with that human's ability and authority to control the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We argue these four properties are necessary for AI systems under meaningful human control, and provide possible directions to incorporate them into practice. We illustrate these properties with two use cases, automated vehicle and AI-based hiring. We believe these four properties will support practically-minded professionals to take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that facilitate meaningful human control and responsibility.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE. Intelligent robotic autonomous systems (unmanned aerial/ground/surface/underwater vehicles) are attractive for military application to relieve humans from tedious or dangerous tasks. These systems require awareness of the environment and their own performance to reach a mission goal. This awareness enables them to adapt their operations to handle unexpected changes in the environment and uncertainty in assessments. Components of the autonomous system cannot rely on perfect awareness or actuator execution, and mistakes of one component can affect the entire system. To obtain a robust system, a system-wide approach is needed and a realistic model of all aspects of the system and its environment. In this paper, we present our study on the design and development of a fully functional autonomous system, consisting of sensors, observation processing and behavior analysis, information database, knowledge base, communication, planning processes, and actuators. The system behaves as a teammate of a human operator and can perform tasks independently with minimal interaction. The system keeps the human informed about relevant developments that may require human assistance, and the human can always redirect the system with high-level instructions. The communication behavior is implemented as a Social AI Layer (SAIL). The autonomous system was tested in a simulation environment to support rapid prototyping and evaluation. The simulation is based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS) with fully modelled sensors and actuators and the 3D graphics-enabled physics simulation software Gazebo. In this simulation, various flying and driving autonomous systems can execute their tasks in a realistic 3D environment with scripted or user-controlled threats. The results show the performance of autonomous operation as well as interaction with humans.},

A long gradual transitionwill occur frommanual driving to automateddriving, inwhichmany yet unknown traffic flow dynamics will be present. These effects have the potential to increasingly aid or cripple current road networks. In this contribution, we investigate these effects using an empirically calibrated and validated simulation experiment, backed up with findings from literature.We found that low-level automated vehicles in mixed traffic will initially have a small negative effect on traffic flow and road capacities.The experiment further showed that any improvement in traffic flow will only be seen at penetration rates above 70%. Also, the capacity drop appeared to be slightly higher with the presence of low-level automated vehicles. The experiment further investigated the effect of bottleneck severity and truck shares on traffic flow. Improvements to current traffic models are recommended and should include a greater detail and understanding of driver-vehicle interaction, both in conventional and in mixed traffic flow. Further research into behavioural shifts in driving is also recommended due to limited data and knowledge of these dynamics.},

Applying MHC to technological systems, such as automated driving is a real challenge, and the main focus of this article. An approach with mathematical elaboration has been developed that offers a first quantifiable operationalisation of MHC for the traffic domain and for use with automated vehicles. A major contribution lies in the taxonomification of control for MHC in the broader traffic environment, including consideration of the driver, the vehicle, the traffic environment, considering behaviour, moral standards and societal values, which are considered in a case study. The demonstration case shows the validity of the developed approach for an automated vehicle overtaking a cyclist on an urban street. This article is one of the first to operationalise MHC to such a level of detail and opens the door to further development of the concept for technological implementation.},

abstract = {Increased on-road testing and market availability of partially automated vehicles (AV) offers researchers and developers the opportunity to evaluate the AV's performance. The occurrence of new types of accidents involving AV's has sparked questions in regard to who is actually in control over and responsible for AV control. In this contribution, we suggest a potential discrepancy in AV control with the review of recently documented accidents involving AV's. The identification of a gap in control is performed using a recently formulated moral philosophical framework of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). This shows a discrepancy between the attribution of responsibility and the ability of a human to fulfil the role assigned to them. While a gap in control is not evident from the viewpoint of operational control, it requires the more intricate concept of MHC to expose it. Recommendations are further made that AV developers and vehicle approval authorities should consider control from a MHC perspective to avoid future gaps in control with the resulting consequences.},

abstract = {With self-driving vehicles (SDVs), pedestrians lose the possibility of making eye contact with an attentive driver. This study investigated whether an external human-machine interface (eHMI) displaying the automated driving mode (a. without eHMI vs. b. with eHMI) affects how pedestrians respond to different driver's states: (1) attentive driver, (2) tinted windshield, (3) distracted driver (within-subject design). At a test site, N = 65 pedestrians crossed a pedestrian crossing while a Wizard-of-Oz SDV approached. We assessed perceived safety and crossing onset times after each trial. Findings reveal that without an eHMI, pedestrians felt significantly less safe if the windshield was tinted or the driver was distracted as compared to an attentive driver. With an eHMI, pedestrians did not differ in perceived safety with regard to the driver's state. We observed no significant differences in pedestrians' crossing onset times. We conclude that an eHMI helps pedestrians to not consider the driver's state.},

Existing taxonomies tend to serve specific purposes such as categorizing transitions between automation modes; however, they cannot be generalized to different systems or combinations of systems. In particular, there is no exhaustive set of use cases that allows entities to assess and validate the HMI of a given ADS that takes into account all possible system modes and transitions. The present paper describes a newly developed framework based on combinatorics of SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) automation levels that incorporates a comprehensive taxonomy of use cases required for the assessment and validation of ADS HMIs.

abstract = {Perception system design is a vital step in the development of an autonomous vehicle (AV). With the vast selection of available off-the-shelf schemes and seemingly endless options of sensor systems implemented in research and commercial vehicles, it can be difficult to identify the optimal system for one's AV application. This article presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art AV perception technology available today. It provides up-to-date information about the advantages, disadvantages, limits, and ideal applications of specific AV sensors; the most prevalent sensors in current research and commercial AVs; autonomous features currently on the market; and localization and mapping methods currently implemented in AV research. This information is useful for newcomers to the AV field to gain a greater understanding of the current AV solution landscape and to guide experienced researchers towards research areas requiring further development. Furthermore, this paper highlights future research areas and draws conclusions about the most effective methods for AV perception and its effect on localization and mapping. Topics discussed in the Perception and Automotive Sensors section focus on the sensors themselves, whereas topics discussed in the Localization and Mapping section focus on how the vehicle perceives where it is on the road, providing context for the use of the automotive sensors. By improving on current state-of-the-art perception systems, AVs will become more robust, reliable, safe, and accessible, ultimately providing greater efficiency, mobility, and safety benefits to the public.},

Yet challenges remain regarding guaranteed performance and safety under all driving circumstances. For instance, planning methods that provide safe and system-compliant performance in complex, cluttered environments while modeling the uncertain interaction with other traffic participants are required. Furthermore, new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed. In this survey, we emphasize recent approaches for integrated perception and planning and for behavior-aware planning, many of which rely on machine learning. This raises the question of verification and safety, which we also touch upon. Finally, we discuss the state of the art and remaining challenges for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles.},

Although the fast developing depth sensors and machine learning methods have given a huge boost to self-driving research, existing autonomous driving vehicles do meet with several avoidable accidents during their road testings. The major cause is the misunderstanding between self-driving systems and human drivers. To solve this problem, we propose a humanlike driving system in this paper to give autonomous vehicles the ability to make decisions like a human. In our method, a convolutional neural network model is used to detect, recognize, and abstract the information in the input road scene, which is captured by the on-board sensors. And then a decision-making system calculates the specific commands to control the vehicles based on the abstractions. The biggest advantage of our work is that we implement a decision-making system which can well adapt to real-life road conditions, in which a massive number of human drivers exist. In addition, we build our perception system with only the depth information, rather than the unstable RGB data. The experimental results give a good demonstration of the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.},

Current control systems implement a hard switch, disabling the automation all at once. However, studies show that the driver's ability to take over depends on his last activity. We therefore propose a system that uses camera based observation of the driver to assess the situation and to predict transition times. We combine this with a control system that uses a cooperative shared control method to support the driver in takeover situations and allows him to adjust safely to the current situation. We present our first steps towards this goal and show both how the behavior of the driver in the interior can be assessed and how a cooperative control transfer can be implemented. We further point out the necessary steps to implement the proposed system and give a first impression of the performance via simulation.},

abstract = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems have the potential to increase roadway capacity and mitigate traffic congestion thanks to the short following distance enabled by inter-vehicle communication. However, due to limitations in acceleration and deceleration capabilities of CACC systems, deactivation and switch to ACC or human-driven mode will take place when conditions are outside the operational design domain. Given the lack of elaborate models on this interaction, existing CACC traffic flow models have not yet been able to reproduce realistic CACC vehicle behaviour and pay little attention to the influence of system deactivation on traffic flow at bottlenecks. This study aims to gain insights into the influence of CACC on highway operations at merging bottlenecks by using a realistic CACC model that captures driver-system interactions and string length limits. We conduct systematic traffic simulations for various CACC market penetration rates (MPR) to derive free-flow capacity and queue discharge rate of the merging section and compare these to the capacity of a homogeneous pipeline section. The results show that an increased CACC MPR can indeed increase the roadway capacity. However, the resulting capacity in the merging bottleneck is much lower than the pipeline capacity and capacity drop persists in bottleneck scenarios at all CACC MPR levels. It is also found that CACC increases flow heterogeneity due to the switch among different operation modes. A microscopic investigation of the CACC operational mode and trajectories reveals a close relation between CACC deactivation, traffic congestion and flow heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Development of vehicle active steering collision avoidance systems calls for mathematical models capable of predicting a human driver's response so as to reduce the cost involved in field tests while accelerating product development. This paper provides a discussion on the paradigms that may be used for modeling a driver's steering interaction with vehicle collision avoidance control in path-following scenarios. Four paradigms, namely decentralized, noncooperative Nash, noncooperative Stackelberg, and cooperative Pareto are established. The decentralized paradigm, which is developed on the basis of optimal control theory, represents a driver's interaction with the collision avoidance controllers that disregard driver steering control. The noncooperative Nash and Stackelberg paradigms are used for predicting a driver's steering behavior in response to the collision avoidance control that actively compensates for driver steering action. These two are devised based on the principles of equilibria in noncooperative game theory. The cooperative Pareto paradigm is derived from cooperative game theory to model a driver's interaction with the collision avoidance systems that take into account the driver's target path. The driver and the collision avoidance controllers' optimization problems and their resulting steering strategies arise in each paradigm are delineated. Two mathematical approaches applicable to these optimization problems namely the distributed model predictive control and the linear quadratic dynamic optimization approaches are described in detail. A case study illustrating a conflict in steering control between driver and vehicle collision avoidance system is performed via simulation. It was found that the variation of driver path-error cost function weights results in a variety of steering behaviors, which are distinct between paradigms.},

For the steering task this structure can be realized with a setup in which driver and automation can apply a torque on the steering wheel in parallel. Thereby both, driver and assistance system, interact with the vehicle and each other over the haptical channel. In the system the driver is given and cannot be changed. The question is how to design the assistance system controller as an ideal complement to the driver. In this paper a formal design concept is applied to this problem which utilizes the fact that adding a controller to the overall system has to lead to a Nash equilibrium. Remaining degrees of freedom are used to optimize the designed controller with respect to a global objective function that specifies overall system performance. We refer the concept as "cooperative shared control design". For the concept driver and vehicle are modeled as a differential game. We show systematically that this concept can be used to determine the optimal assistance system if the driver characteristics are known. Simulations prove the applicability of this concept.},

In particular, we focus on the operationalization of the first of the two conditions (Santoni de Sio and Van den Hoven 2018) investigated: the so-called ‘tracking' condition. Our investigation is led in relation to one specific subcase of automated system: dual-mode driving systems (e.g. Tesla ‘autopilot'). First, we connect and compare meaningful human control with a concept of control very popular in engineering and traffic psychology (Michon 1985), and we explain to what extent tracking resembles and differs from it. This will help clarifying the extent to which the idea of meaningful human control is connected to, but also goes beyond, current notions of control in engineering and psychology. Second, we take the systematic analysis of practical reasoning as traditionally presented in the philosophy of human action (Anscombe, Bratman, Mele) and we adapt it to offer a general framework where different types of reasons and agents are identified according to their relation to an automated system's behaviour. This framework is meant to help explaining what reasons and what agents (should) play a role in controlling a given system, thereby enabling policy makers to produce usable guidelines and engineers to design systems that properly respond to selected human reasons. In the final part, we discuss a practical example of how our framework could be employed in designing automated driving systems.},

abstract = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) are important technologies for the achievement of vehicle automation, and their effect on traffic systems generally is evaluated with microscopic traffic simulations. A successful simulation requires realistic vehicle behavior and minimal vehicle collisions. However, most existing ACC-CACC simulation studies used simplified models that were not based on real vehicle response. The studies rarely addressed collision avoidance in the simulation. The study presented in this paper developed a realistic and collision-free car-following model for ACC-CACC vehicles. A multiregime model combining a realistic ACC-CACC system with driver intervention for vehicle longitudinal motions is proposed. This model assumes that a human driver resumes vehicle control either according to his or her assessment or after a collision warning asks the driver to take over. The proposed model was tested in a wide range of scenarios to explore model performance and collision possibilities. The testing scenarios included three regular scenarios of stop-and-go, approaching, and cut-out maneuvers, as well as two extreme safetyconcerned maneuvers of hard brake and cut-in. The simulation results show that the proposed model is collision free in the full-speed-range operation with leader accelerations within -1 to 1 m/s2 and in approaching and cut-out scenarios. Those results indicate that the proposed ACC-CACC car-following model can produce realistic vehicle response without causing vehicle collisions in regular scenarios for vehicle string operations.},

There is consensus that vehicles should not perform actions that are unacceptable to humans. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) as a function of a framework of the Automated Driving System (ADS). This framework is constructed through the core components that make up the ADS, primarily considered within the categories of the vehicle and driver. Identification of these components and the chain of control allow traceability of MHC to be performed, and aids vehicle manufacturers, software developers, other vehicle component designers, and vehicle- and driver licensing authorities to address many challenges related to the design and preservation of human control in automated vehicles. Operationalisation of MHC is discussed in the paper including a suggested approach that should aid understanding and the application of the concept. Four application examples are given and recommendations are made in regard to vehicle design, human machine interaction, transition of control, driver training, vehicle approval, and other topics.

abstract = {A Hidden Markov Model framework is introduced to formalize the beliefs that humans may have about the mode in which a semi-automated vehicle is operating. Previous research has identified various “levels of automation,” which serve to clarify the different degrees of a vehicle's automation capabilities and expected operator involvement. However, a vehicle that is designed to perform at a certain level of automation can actually operate across different modes of automation within its designated level, and its operational mode might also change over time. Confusion can arise when the user fails to understand the mode of automation that is in operation at any given time, and this potential for confusion is not captured in models that simply identify levels of automation. In contrast, the Hidden Markov Model framework provides a systematic and formal specification of mode confusion due to incorrect user beliefs. The framework aligns with theory and practice in various interdisciplinary approaches to the field of vehicle automation. Therefore, it contributes to the principled design and evaluation of automated systems and future transportation systems.},
